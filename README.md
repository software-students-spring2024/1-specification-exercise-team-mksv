(an extreme game lover)
Kevin Zhang:    Goal:       1.All video games should be easy to find the game the user needs.
                            2.There should be in-time custom services (if user find out he does not like this game in first few days, he is able to get a refund)
                Problems:   1.The game website does not clearly states the compatiblity of hardware, resulting in a refund
                            2.catagorize the game poorly, unable to find the game user wants.
            

## Product Vision Statement

Our vision is to create user-friendly video game app, where every gamer can discover effortlessly and purchase their desired games, with reliable after-sale services.


## User Requirements

1.As a gamer, I want to search for games by categories so that I can find exactly what I'm looking for quickly.
2.As a customer, I want to get a easy way for refund so that if I don't like the game, I can get refund quickly.
3.As a customer, I want to have a forum about the game so that I can know the game before I make the decision.
