## Stakeholders


Alex Du(my brother)<br>
Goals/needs/desires:
- Wants to be able to purchase digital copies of older/retro video games
- Wants to be able to do so on the go<br><br>
Problems/frustrations:
- Is dissatisfied with distribution services like Steam which have too many extra functions that don't have to do with simply buying a game
- Most retro games(ROMs for emulators) usually require piracy, and he would like to purchase these legally because he plans on working for the government in the future<br>


Kevin Zhang(an extreme game lover)<br>
Goal:
- All video games should be easy to find the game the user needs.
- There should be in-time custom services (if user find out he does not like this game in first few days, he is able to get a refund)<br>
Problems:<br><br>
- The game website does not clearly states the compatiblity of hardware, resulting in a refund
- catagorize the game poorly, unable to find the game user wants.<br>
            

## Product Vision Statement

Our vision is to create user-friendly video game app, where every gamer can discover effortlessly and purchase their desired games, with reliable after-sale services.


## User Requirements

1.As a gamer, I want to search for games by categories so that I can find exactly what I'm looking for quickly.<br><br>
2.As a customer, I want to get a easy way for refund so that if I don't like the game, I can get refund quickly.<br><br>
3.As a customer, I want to have a forum about the game so that I can know the game before I make the decision.<br><br>
4.As a person who still lives with their parents, I want to be able to legitimately own copies of old video games so that my ISP does not send a stern letter to my mom and dad.<br><br>
5.As a person who gets distracted easily, I want to purchase video games without being bombarded by additional features so that I can spend as little time online as possible.<br><br>
