## Stakeholders


Alex Du(my brother)<br>
Goals/needs/desires:<br>
- Wants to be able to purchase digital copies of older/retro video games
- Wants to be able to do so on the go<br>
Problems/frustrations:<br>
- Is dissatisfied with distribution services like Steam which have too many extra functions that don't have to do with simply buying a game
- Most retro games(ROMs for emulators) usually require piracy, and he would like to purchase these legally because he plans on working for the government in the future<br>

## User Requirements

As a person who still lives with their parents, I want to be able to legitimately own copies of old video games so that my ISP does not send a stern letter to my mom and dad.<br>
As a person who gets distracted easily, I want to purchase video games without being bombarded by additional features so that I can spend as little time online as possible.<br>
