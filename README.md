## Stakeholders


Alex Du(my brother)
Goals/needs/desires:
- Wants to be able to purchase digital copies of older/retro video games
- Wants to be able to do so on the go
Problems/frustrations:
- Is dissatisfied with distribution services like Steam which have too many extra functions that don't have to do with simply buying a game
- Most retro games(ROMs for emulators) usually require piracy, and he would like to purchase these legally because he plans on working for the government in the future


(an extreme game lover)
Kevin Zhang:    Goal:       1.All video games should be easy to find the game the user needs.
                            2.There should be in-time custom services (if user find out he does not like this game in first few days, he is able to get a refund)
                Problems:   1.The game website does not clearly states the compatiblity of hardware, resulting in a refund
                            2.catagorize the game poorly, unable to find the game user wants.
            

## Product Vision Statement

Our vision is to create user-friendly video game app, where every gamer can discover effortlessly and purchase their desired games, with reliable after-sale services.


## User Requirements

1.As a gamer, I want to search for games by categories so that I can find exactly what I'm looking for quickly.
2.As a customer, I want to get a easy way for refund so that if I don't like the game, I can get refund quickly.
3.As a customer, I want to have a forum about the game so that I can know the game before I make the decision.
4.As a person who still lives with their parents, I want to be able to legitimately own copies of old video games so that my ISP does not send a stern letter to my mom and dad.
5.As a person who gets distracted easily, I want to purchase video games without being bombarded by additional features so that I can spend as little time online as possible.
